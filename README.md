React/Fetch API
I have built a movie app that utilizes the Axios library to fetch data from an API, 
Manages state using the useState hook, 
Handles data fetching using the useEffect hook. 
Also incorporated array methods such as filter and map to filter and display only the movies that match the user's search criteria.
I am  Considering adding more features and error handling to further enhance the app's functionality.when i learn backed developement


POTENTIAL FUTURE FEATURES, 
I could consider adding additional functionality such as pagination,
sorting options, or the ability to save favorite movies.
Additionally, i may want to incorporate error handling to gracefully handle situations where the API may not be available or
return unexpected data.



LESSONS LEARNED 
i have learned how to handle side effect in react app, using the useeffect hook
first i had trouble with the dependeny array, where i got in to infinite loop, but late on i figured it out
